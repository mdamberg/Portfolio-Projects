# Automating Survey Data Processing with SurveyMonkey API

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a **data pipeline** to automate the retrieval and processing of survey responses from **SurveyMonkey**. Using **Python**, I integrated with the **SurveyMonkey API** to fetch survey metadata and response data, transforming it into a structured format suitable for analysis and reporting.

## Key Features & Techniques Used

### ✅ **API Integration with SurveyMonkey**
- Utilized Python's `requests` library to interact with the **SurveyMonkey API**, securely accessing survey data using an API token.

### 🔍 **Dynamic Data Extraction**
- Extracted survey questions, answer choices, and responses dynamically, ensuring that all data points are captured accurately.

### 🔄 **Data Transformation**
- Mapped **question IDs** to human-readable text for easier interpretation.
- Converted complex **JSON response structures** into a tidy Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

### 📊 **Automation of Data Export**
- Exported processed survey responses to **Excel** for further analysis, making the data easily accessible for stakeholders.

## **Workflow**
1. **API Authentication**
   - Configured API access using **secure tokens** to ensure authorized data retrieval.
   
2. **Data Retrieval**
   - Fetched survey details and responses, handling **pagination** to capture large datasets efficiently.
   
3. **Data Processing**
   - Transformed response data into structured tables, mapping **question IDs to meaningful text**.
   
4. **Export & Reporting**
   - Saved the processed data into **Excel files** for easy sharing and visualization.

## **Use Cases**
📌 **Automating survey response collection** for ongoing feedback.  
📌 **Simplifying data analysis** by transforming API data into readable formats.  
📌 **Enhancing reporting capabilities** for health monitoring and infection control.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `requests`
- **Data Source:** SurveyMonkey API
- **Output:** Excel Report 📂

## **Challenges & Solutions**
### 🔄 **Handling Complex JSON Structures**
- Implemented **recursive data extraction** techniques to handle nested JSON data.

### 🎯 **Ensuring Data Accuracy**
- Validated API responses and handled errors **gracefully** to ensure **reliable data extraction**.

## **Future Improvements 🚀**
✅ **Automate the pipeline** with scheduled scripts or cloud-based workflows.  
✅ **Integrate with data visualization tools** like Power BI or Tableau for enhanced insights.
