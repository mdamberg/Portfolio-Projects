# Antibiotic-Usage-Analysis

## Overview:

This project provides an interactive dashboard to analyze antibiotic prescribing patterns within a healthcare environment. It focuses on key metrics like total prescriptions, antibiotic distribution by time period, average treatment durations, and trends in antibiotic resistance. All data is anonymized to ensure no protected health information is disclosed.

## Key Features:

- **Time-Based Analysis**: Examine antibiotic usage by quarter, month, or day.
- **Drug Frequency:** Identify which antibiotics are most frequently prescribed.
 -**Treatment Duration Monitoring**: Track average days of therapy against stewardship targets (standard is ≤7 days).
- **Resistance Tracking**: Review the frequency of resistant organisms to inform clinical decision-making.

## Data Privacy:
The dataset does not contain any direct identifiers (names, dates of birth, etc.). Unique Resident IDs are anonymized and cannot be linked to individual identities, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

**Intended Users**:

1. Infection prevention specialists
2. Health Care Data Analysts
3. Healthcare quality improvement teams
4. Clinical pharmacists and antibiotic stewardship coordinators

## Dependencies & Tools:

- **Visualization Platform**: Power BI
- **Source Data**: Excel xlsx file 

## Customization:
- Adjust date ranges or add/remove metrics by modifying the underlying queries or data sources.
- Incorporate additional resistance data or stewardship benchmarks as needed.
