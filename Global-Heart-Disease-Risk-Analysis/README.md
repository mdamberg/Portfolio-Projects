# Global-Heart-Disease-Risk-Analysis

## Overview:
This project provides an interactive dashboard to examine heart disease risk factors in relation to geographic areas. By analyzing data on obesity, cholesterol levels, high BMI counts, and smoking prevalence, it demonstrates how location can influence cardiovascular health outcomes.

##Key Features:

- **Geographic Filters**: Focus on specific continents, countries, or hemispheres to understand regional variations.
- **Risk Factor Insights**: Observe how obesity, cholesterol, and BMI correlate with heart attack risk.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Compare male/female populations and track family history patterns.
- **Time & Condition Correlations**: Relate systolic pressure or other health metrics to heart disease incidence.

## Usage:

- Open the dashboard file in your chosen data visualization tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
- Use geographic and demographic filters to refine views.
- Interpret charts to identify patterns, high-risk areas, and influential factors.
- Apply insights to guide healthcare resource allocation, policy-making, or further research.

## Data & Format:

- **Source data**: Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset available [HERE]([https://example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset))
      - **Source File**: heart_attack_prediction_dates.csv
- Data Formatting and cleaning.

   - **Unique Values**: 8763
   - - **Data Cleaning**: Data is in a pre-cleaned format and is ready for import into visualization tool, although further field creation can be done.

## Customization:

- Add new risk factors or demographic segments as needed.
- Integrate socioeconomic data or healthcare access metrics to enhance context (ie. Gender, Income, Geograpgic Region)
