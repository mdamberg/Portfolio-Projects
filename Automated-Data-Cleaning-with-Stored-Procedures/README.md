# Automated Data Cleaning for Vaccination Records

## Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw, unstructured data into clean, actionable insights using SQL Server. By automating the data cleaning process with Stored Procedures, I streamlined a previously manual workflow into a seamless, efficient ETL pipeline. The system ensures accurate, standardized datasets for healthcare reporting while significantly reducing time spent on repetitive tasks. While the system requires consistent table structures, adjustments to the Stored Procedures accommodate any changes, showcasing adaptability and attention to detail.

## Key Features

- **Remove Empty Rows:** Deletes unnecessary rows, preserving essential data structure.
- **Drop Irrelevant Columns**: Optimizes database performance by focusing only on relevant fields.
- **Rename Columns:** Creates standardized, intuitive column names for ease of reporting.
- **Adjust Data Types**: Ensures correct data handling for accurate calculations and analysis.

## Usage

1. Import Excel data into SQL Server.
2. Execute the corresponding stored procedure for each table (e.g., EXEC CleanEmpCovidVaccData).
3. Use the cleaned data for reporting, dashboards, or further analysis.

## Benefits

- Efficiency Gains: Automates repetitive tasks, saving hours of manual effort and minimizing errors.
- Data Quality: Guarantees clean, reliable datasets for regulatory compliance and decision-making.
- Scalable Solution: Handles large, routine data imports with ease, ready to adapt as needs grow.
- Actionable Insights: Ensures that decision-makers have access to accurate, timely information.
- Problem-Solving Approach: Tackled the challenge of inconsistent data imports, delivering a tailored solution that meets healthcare-specific needs.

## Why It Matters

This project highlights my expertise in SQL, ETL process design, and data quality management. It also reflects my ability to identify inefficiencies, develop tailored solutions, and deliver results that align with organizational goalsâ€”skills that are valuable in any data-driven role.
